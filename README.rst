.. warning:: This toolsuite is in it's very early stages and will change often.

Hey! Listen!
------------

This tool is in **very** early development. The CLI is a WIP and may not be completely plumbed up yet.
If you'd like to help out and know Python, try out the API a little bit and see if you run into errors parsing
files! We're also at the stage that feature/usability feedback would be much appreciated.


Features
--------

* cli interface
* TODO


CLI Examples
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    usage: scdt [-h] [--verbose] [--stderr] [--command-timeout COMMAND_TIMEOUT] [command] ...

    positional arguments:
      [command]             Subcommand to run, if missing the interactive mode is started instead.
        cryxml-to-json      Convert a CryXML file to JSON
        cryxml-to-xml       Convert a CryXML file to xml
        unforge             Convert a DataForge file to a readable format
        unp4k               Extract files from a P4K file
        actionmap           Dumps the default profile action map (keybinds) as JSON


API Examples
------------

Read a DataForge database (.dcb)

.. code-block:: python

    from scdatatools.forge import DataCoreBinary
    dcb = DataCoreBinary('research/Game.dcb.3.9.1-ptu.5229583')
    jav_records = dcb.search_filename('*javelin.xml')
    print(dcb.dump_record_json(jav_records[-1]))


Use the `StarCitizen` class:

.. code-block:: python

    from scdatatools.sc import StarCitizen
    sc = StarCitizen('D:/Path/To/LIVE')
    sc.p4k.search('idris')
    sc.datacore.records[0]


Special Thanks
--------------

A huge thanks goes out to `dolkensp <https://github.com/dolkensp/unp4k>`_ (aka alluran) for doing all the initial hard
work reversing the P4K and DataForge file formats! This would've taken a lot longer with his efforts.
